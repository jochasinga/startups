## Starting

### Company-as-a-Service (CaaS)

Platforms for registering a company on behalf of yourself.

+ [Gust Launch][gust-launch]
+ [Clerky][clerky]
+ [Stripe Atlas][stripe-atlas]

#### Gust Launch

The fastest operator of all, Gust registered my company [Referkit, Inc.][referkit-inc] and came back with a [Employer Identification Number (EIN)][ein] in just under **2 days** due to itself being . It is also very responsive to real-time questions online and provide in-depth documentations on its website.

Note that with its **Starter Plan** it won't set up a bank account for you. 

##### Pros
+ Get EIN back in 2 days (IRS actual letter comes in 2 weeks)
+ Gust is Delaware agent, so you aren't paying this addition fee
+ Guided steps are clear and less scary
+ Previews of real documents before signing (transparent)
+ Good documentations / FAQs
+ Enforced opinionated best practices

##### Cons
+ Immediate charge of $300 when signing up (for **Starter Plan**)
+ No bank account created for you (avaialable with other plans)
+ Only Delaware C-corp registrations offered
+ Less flexible, opinionated best practice such as:
  - Discount-only SAFE offered
  - No equity-crowdfunding captable support
+ [Foreign Qualification][foreign-qualification] Registration is delegated to a third-party [Harvard Business Service][harvard-filing], which operates independently from Gust and is pretty slow and unresponsive.

##### Author's take ⭐⭐⭐✨

3.5 stars for very quick C-Corp setup and very straight-forward, no-frill UI steps and transparent preview of all documents before signing. So far, the Foreign Qualification registration done through [Harvard Business Service][harvard-filing] had been less than impressive. They sent a separate email asking me to sign and submit Form [S&DC-S/N][fq-form](which could have been integrated into Gust) with no follow-up or notification. I'd missed their email and wasted weeks thinking all I had to do was wait since the payment for the registration was also charged by Gust.

I had to talk in person with a Gust customer service (which is by far great) to learn about this required document. After I've emailed them the signed form, they never responded. It's been 35 days until now since I've started the corporation process and I'm still waiting for the qualification to kick in.

#### Stripe Atlas

> 👋 Help wanted

Stripe Atlas was the first provider I went with, and I had limited interactions with the platform. However, I spent north of **3 weeks** emailing back and forth with an agent who was trying to "influent" me into saying yes to using its product [Stripe Connect][stripe-connect] to facilitate payment in order to answer its mandatory banking requirement. Here is an excerpt from an email:

> Stripe is required by law to complete what’s called a KYC (Know Your Customer) survey for each Stripe Atlas application. This involves completing in-depth reviews of every business, including what you’re selling, how you intend to sell it, your own description of your products and services, your website, and myriad other details and bits of minutiae.

I've later learned that because it also facilitates opening up a bank account with [Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)][svb], you can expect the process to take weeks before getting an EIN *and* a bank account set up.

Stripe Atlas might be an ideal choice for foreign entrepreneurs who want to establish a company in the US, but for me getting a company set up quickly and without human's intervention was why I went with [Gust Launch][gust-launch].

##### Pros

+ Attached to Stripe branding
+ Automatically create a Stripe account and SVB bank account for you

##### Cons

+ Process take weeks
+ Additional Delaware agent fee
+ Occasional human interventions

### Taxes

#### Corporate

> 🚧 TODO

#### Personal

Personal tax (as an officer of your company or employee in general) tips are:

##### IRA (Individual Retirement Account)
Put your retirement money into an **[IRA][what-is-ira]** account if you have no plans to contribute or contribute little in the first (few) years when you might not be able to afford big paycheck or set your company up to match your 401k contribution.

You can read about the differences between [IRA and Roth IRA][ira-vs-roth-ira].

Basically **IRA and 401k** are both vessels for you to defer your tax for the portion of your income you contribute to your future (older) self by deducting your contribution from your tax filing each year, and pay ordinary income tax once you cash out.

**Roth IRA** is a bit different because it basically let you pay tax for your contribution as normal, but it's tax-free when you cash out. It's also more flexible because you **can withdraw your contribution at any time without any tax or penalty fee**. Basically, if you plan to get richer at an older age (aka upgraded to a higher tax bracket), Roth is ideal because you won't pay a dime when you cash out.

IRA and Roth IRA have a maximum contribution limit of $6,000/year (as of 2019-2020 for people below 70 years old), but you could invest in stocks, ETFs, bonds, options usually for zero or little fee based on the [broker][etrade-ira-info] you choose.

##### 401k
Put your retirement money into a [401k][401k] attached with your company if you can match and contribute.
