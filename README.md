## Starting

### Company-as-a-Service (CaaS)

Platforms for registering a company on behalf of yourself.

+ [Gust Launch][gust-launch]
+ [Clerky][clerky]
+ [Stripe Atlas][stripe-atlas]

#### Gust Launch

The fastest operator of all, Gust registered my company [Referkit, Inc.][referkit-inc] and came back with a [Employer Identification Number (EIN)][ein] in just under **2 days** due to itself being . It is also very responsive to real-time questions online and provide in-depth documentations on its website.

Note that with its **Starter Plan** it won't set up a bank account for you.

##### Pros
+ Get EIN back in 2 days (IRS actual letter comes in 2 weeks)
+ Gust is Delaware agent, so you aren't paying this addition fee
+ Guided steps are clear and less scary
+ Previews of real documents before signing (transparent)
+ Good documentations / FAQs
+ Enforced opinionated best practices

##### Cons
+ Immediate charge of $300 when signing up (for **Starter Plan**)
+ No bank account created for you (avaialable with other plans)
+ Only Delaware C-corp registrations offered
+ Less flexible, opinionated best practice such as:
  - Discount-only SAFE offered
  - No equity-crowdfunding support

#### Stripe Atlas
Stripe Atlas was the first provider I went with, and I had limited interactions with the platform. However, I spent north of **3 weeks** emailing back and forth with an agent who was trying to "influent" me into saying yes to using its product [Stripe Connect][stripe-connect] to facilitate payment in order to answer its mandatory banking requirement. Here is an excerpt from an email:

> Stripe is required by law to complete what’s called a KYC (Know Your Customer) survey for each Stripe Atlas application. This involves completing in-depth reviews of every business, including what you’re selling, how you intend to sell it, your own description of your products and services, your website, and myriad other details and bits of minutiae.

I've later learned that because it also facilitates opening up a bank account with [Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)][svb], you can expect the process to take weeks before getting an EIN *and* a bank account set up.

Stripe Atlas might be an ideal choice for foreign entrepreneurs who want to establish a company in the US, but for me getting a company set up quickly and without human's intervention was why I went with [Gust Launch][gust-launch].

##### Pros
+ Attached to Stripe branding
+ Automatically create a Stripe account and SVB bank account for you

##### Cons
+ Process take weeks
+ Additional Delaware agent fee
+ Occasional human interventions
